# Ricetta
Ricetta is a full-stack web application designed to manage and store recipes, providing users with the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their recipes.

Built with a robust backend using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, Ricetta ensures data integrity and efficient database management through Sequelize ORM. The frontend, developed with React and powered by Vite, offers a seamless and responsive user experience. The project also incorporates secure user authentication with Supabase and is deployed on Heroku, ensuring accessibility and scalability.
